Voting Machine Project



Overview:
This project implements a voting machine using  Verilog and tested using Vivado.

modules:

1)buttoncontrol: 

-The vote should be logged only after button has been pressured for a certain amount of time.Only a singlevote should be logged if button is 
                   pressured for large duration.

2)modecontrol:

-Used for control of LEDs.For voting mode, LEDs are light up for a second to indicate the vote has been casted.For tally mode, LEDs light up in 
                binary numbers to indicate the number of votes recieved by candidate.

3)votelogger:

-Logs the valid votes if it is the proper mode.Also used to reset the values at the start of operation.

4)votingmachine: Top module


software:
Xilinx Vivado

How to Run



Clone the repository:



git clone https://github.com/kranthiuppada/votingMachineProject.git

cd votingMachineProject



Open Vivado and import the Verilog files.



Run the testbench (votingMachine_tb.v) to verify the design.



Analyze the waveform results in the simulator.
